                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Welcome to my blog post. I created this page to recount the experiences that I had as an intern with GeoCorps of America hosted by the U.S. Forest Service in the Umpqua National Forest, Oregon. This position took place during the summer of 2021, June through August, and focused on field methods developed by the Rocky Mountain Research Station to understand and to quantify how road-derived sediment affects local watershed health. The Umpqua National Forest is the home to multiple native species of anadromous fish, such as chinook and coho salmon, which are highly sensitive to the polluting sediment in their waterways. Working as a team of four, we mapped over 85 miles of roads between the Steelhead Creek and Little River Watersheds. It was a great summer, and I’m excited for you to learn more about it below.</p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Training</h2>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our summer started with the team meeting up in Boise, ID, to train with the creators of the modeling toolkit named GRAIP, Geomorphic Road Analysis and Inventory Package, that would be the basis of our fieldwork.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first day, we spent the afternoon learning about the basic construction of a road prism and the different methods that are used to remove water from it. These drain points are diverse and fundamental to the amount of erosion that occurs both in the road fill and surrounding forested areas. The two governing factors for sediment removal that are controlled by these drain points are their frequency and quality of construction, which will depend on the topography that the road crosses and the land use or ownership. The quality of the road also makes a large difference, since a more heavily graveled road surface will diffuse the energy of the water as it passes through to access the more erodible fill sediments.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The remainder of the week involved actual field work in the nearby Boise National Forest. We camped just outside of Garden Valley, ID, where there were hot springs to enjoy just across the road. While the field work is simple, it took us a few days to acclimate to all the various options in the drop-down menus of the GRAIP data dictionary created for our Trimble GPS units. Starting with a relatively easy road, we were introduced to stream crossings first. These are features where the stream crosses under the road, usually through a large culvert, which are the most rigorously measured of all the drain point types. Using a stadia rod and sighting scope, we were taught to measure the length of the culvert, the fill depth of the road over the culvert, and the pipe’s grade. The scope has three lines and a level so that you can sight where they fall on the stadia rod. Using trigonometry, we can determine all the mentioned measurements since the angle from the eye to the lines in the scope are known, as is the distance between each line where they fall on the stadia rod. A diagram of how this works is shown above.

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Returning to the Umpqua</h2>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first few weeks of our project involved lots of troubleshooting problems with our equipment, familiarizing ourselves with the local flora (mostly poison oak), and getting to know our surroundings in general. We started our project in the Steamboat Creek watershed alongside the Steelhead Creek. This location was only a few miles away from our home, so we would often get home after a long day and drive back up the same road to swim in the warmer spots of the water. We rotated teams every week, so we quickly got into a steady workflow and were able to GRAIP just over 26 miles of this area.</p>

                            </figure>
                             <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We found that although the main roads were well-maintained, many of the spur roads in this watershed had become overgrown with trees and ferns. We often found ourselves in remote areas, where the only way we could find the road was with our maps. Around this time of the summer, the first of the heatwaves to hit the pacific northwest region began to push the daily temperature high above 100°F. We used some of these days hotter days in the office to figure out how to process the data on our computers, but often times we just hoped for thick tree cover.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For a day, we also had the privilege of shadowing hydrologists from the forest service (our supervisor included) as they were making observations for the start of a potential watershed restoration project. The stream was in a wide glacial valley, and cut through a meadow composed largely of grasses and small wildflowers. The meadow was a popular pasture for cattle, which resulted in the deep incision of the stream. The farther it became incised, the deeper the groundwater table would sink to match the stream. As a result, many of the observations focused on where beaver dam analogs could be placed to restore the natural hydrology of the meadow to a more marsh-like environment. </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">On our weekends, we often did trips with each other to go exploring around Oregon. We got to experience places like Crater Lake, Mt. Thielson, the Newberry Lava Fields, and the coast together. During the times when we would split off, I found myself visiting the John Day National Monument and Mt. Hood. These were some incredible sights that I appreciate having had the opportunity to visit.

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">July 5th: The Jack Fire Ignites</h2>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Monday after the 4th of July weekend, we all got one more opportunity to survey the roads in the Steamboat area. On July 5th, the Jack Fire started burning near the Horseshoe Bend area roughly 10 miles away from our field site, and our plans for the summer suddenly became uncertain. For the remainder of that week, we took the opportunity to catch-up on office work such as correcting the GPS data and working to understand the preprocessor script for the model. After splitting up to different places that weekend, our crew had to evacuate our original housing to another forest service bunk house near the Toketee Ranger Station. </p>

                              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The following two weeks we would shift gears and focus our efforts on taking samples and locating plots for a project under the name LTSP, or Long-Term Soil Productivity. This project began 25 years ago and was trying to determine the long-term ecological effects of soil compaction in logged areas. The sample plots in the Umpqua were located closer to our temporary home in Toketee, and since our previous field site was no longer accessible to us, we were able to avoid driving around the forest fire that closed Highway 138. The sampling methods were simple for this new project and involved collecting forest floor debris (leaves and pine needles) and taking a 30cm soil core sample using a slide hammer. Many of the plots were covered with tall native Ceanothus and Rhododendron, which made navigating through them both lots of fun and very difficult. I particularly enjoyed hunting for the corners of these plots, which after 25 years of growth made for a challenge.</p>
                              <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" style="width:100%" src="assets/IMG_6276.jpeg" alt="..." />

                              </figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">By the end of this project, we were assigned a new watershed to GRAIP near the Little River. Since access to this area would normally have traversed the current fire-ban zone, we had to detour through Glide and enter the forest roads past the Wolf Creek Campground (a total of 1.5 hours). With this new commute, we were able to see a much larger portion of the area we were living in every day. There were serpentine road cuts along the highway that we were able to admire, and the local geology seemed entirely different even though we were just on the other side of the ridge. The roads in this new watershed were well-maintained, which may have been due to the larger lots of privately owned logging plots. </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As the summer progressed, the Jack Fire was joined by a complex of lightning-generated fires named the Rough Patch as well as other smaller fires. One of these, the South Chilcoot fire, even burned in an area where we had previously surveyed the roads this summer. Aside from learning about how wildfires are managed, it became even more clear how we were helping with our project to identify fragile areas within the watersheds. Since the surveys give a clear picture of the conditions of the roads before a fire hits, it can be used as evidence to secure funding and focusing efforts on restoring already fragile portions of the road systems that have become more fragile due to the loss of vegetation and burning. </p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Two Remain</h2>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" style="width:100%" src="assets/1628537739973.jpg" alt="..." />

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">By the end of the summer, Jake and Kayla had left to go to graduate school and Bailey and I had stayed to finish up the project. By the end of all of our GRAIPing efforts, the four of us had surveyed over 86 miles of forest roads between the two watersheds. Bailey and I focused on getting the last of our GPS data preprocessed and run through the model, as well as tying off loose ends. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Reflecting on my summer in the Umpqua, I understand what a fantastic opportunity I had been given to live in the forest and experience a lifestyle so different to the one I have living in an urban setting. I had the opportunity to develop the beginnings of my career path as a geoscientist, meet professionals who could give me a sense of what it is like to work for the forest service, and understand the new risks of living in a forested area as the west coast faces longer periods of drought and unprecedented heat. </p>
